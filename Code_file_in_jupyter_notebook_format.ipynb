# Premier league table constructer

The goal of pour project is to create a standardised script that can turn all match information of a season of any of the top European football leagues into the correct season table. This includes restructuring the data, calculating the goal difference, points, wins, loses and draws per team and ranking the teams according to the rules of the game.

Furthermore, we aim to compare the performance of the clubs over time and provide detailed information on the best performing club of three seasons. Therefore, we rank the clubs based on their average performance of the previous seasons and pull information on the top-performing club via API.

### Organising the data
In the organise_data function, we are changing the format (CSV) from the data input to fit our purpose and creating a dictionary with the relevant data points.
This is done by splitting the CSV data into columns and creating a dictionary with matches as keys and relevant individual match information:

def organise_data(data):
    data = open(data, "r")
    dict1 = {}
    number = 0
    for i in data:
        if number == 0:
            number +=1
        else:
            line = i.strip().split(",")
            Home_team = line[1]
            Away_team = line[2]
            GH = int(line[3])
            GA = int(line[4])
            YH = int(line[5])
            YA = int(line[6])

            dict1[number] = [Home_team, Away_team, GH, GA, YH, YA]

            number += 1
        
    return dict1

season_16_17 = organise_data("16_17_revised.csv")
season_17_18 = organise_data("17_18_revised.csv")
season_18_19 = organise_data("18_19_revised.csv")


### Allocate points and goal difference
In the allocate_pounts_and_goaldiff function, we are creating a dictionary of all the teams in the league (20 in total), by restructuring the previous dictionary with individual matches as keys to a dictionary that with the individual teams as keys.
Simultaneously counting matches, wins, loses and draws per team and calculating goal difference and point allocation:

def allocate_points_and_goaldiff(data, season):
    # Creating a dictionary of all the teams in the league, 20 in total:
    dict1={}
    for i in data.keys():
        dict1[data[i][0]]={"Games_played":0,"Wins":0, "Losses":0, "Draws":0, "Points":0, "Goal_diff":0, "Yellow_cards":0}
    assert len(dict1)==20
    
    # Allocate points and goaldiff for each match:
    for x in data.keys():
        #Matched played:
        dict1[data[x][0]]["Games_played"] +=1
        dict1[data[x][1]]["Games_played"] +=1

        #Allocation of points:
        if data[x][2] > data[x][3]:
            dict1[data[x][0]]["Wins"] +=1
            dict1[data[x][0]]["Points"] += 3
            dict1[data[x][1]]["Losses"] += 1
        
        if data[x][2] < data[x][3]:
            dict1[data[x][1]]["Wins"] += 1
            dict1[data[x][1]]["Points"] += 3
            dict1[data[x][0]]["Losses"] += 1
        
        if data[x][2] == data[x][3]:
            dict1[data[x][1]]["Draws"] += 1
            dict1[data[x][1]]["Points"] += 1
            dict1[data[x][0]]["Points"] += 1
            dict1[data[x][0]]["Draws"] += 1
            
        #Calculating goal-diff:
        dict1[data[x][0]]["Goal_diff"] += (data[x][2] - data[x][3])
        dict1[data[x][1]]["Goal_diff"] += (data[x][3] - data[x][2])
        
        #Calculating yellow-card statistics:
        dict1[data[x][0]]["Yellow_cards"] += data[x][4]
        dict1[data[x][1]]["Yellow_cards"] += data[x][5]
            
    return dict1      
    
    
allocation_season_16_17= allocate_points_and_goaldiff(season_16_17, "16/17")
allocation_season_17_18= allocate_points_and_goaldiff(season_17_18, "17_18")
allocation_season_18_19= allocate_points_and_goaldiff(season_18_19, "18_19")

### Ranking of the teams
Restructuring the dictionary to sort the teams according to the criteria of a football table:

 def rank_teams(data):
    points= {}
    for i in data.keys():
        points[i]=data[i]['Points']
    ls = points.values(); ls = list(ls);ls.sort(reverse=True)
    ranked_dict = {} 
    for i in ls: 
        for p in points:
            if i == points[p]:
                ranked_dict[p]=i
    equal_points = []
    for i in ranked_dict.keys():
        n = 0    
        for p in ls:
            if ranked_dict[i]==p:
                n+=1
        if n >=2:
            equal_points.append(i)
    if equal_points == []:
        return(ranked_dict)
    else:
        #print("Warning: There are "+str(len(equal_points))+" teams that share the same amount of points with at least one other team")
        goal_diff = {}
        for i in equal_points:
            goal_diff[i] = data[i]["Goal_diff"]
        gd = list(goal_diff.values())
        gd.sort(reverse=True)
        w_gd ={}
        for i in gd: 
            for p in goal_diff:
                if i == goal_diff[p]:
                    w_gd[p]=i
        n=0
        for i in w_gd:
            ranked_dict[i]+=n
            n-=0.01
        ls = ranked_dict.values(); ls = list(ls);ls.sort(reverse=True)
        new_ranked_dict={}
        for i in ls: 
            for p in ranked_dict:
                if i == ranked_dict[p]:
                    new_ranked_dict[p]=i
        for i in new_ranked_dict:
            new_ranked_dict[i]=data[i]
        return (new_ranked_dict)

    
table1_season_16_17 = rank_teams(allocation_season_16_17)  
table1_season_17_18 = rank_teams(allocation_season_17_18)
table1_season_18_19 = rank_teams(allocation_season_18_19)
merge_dictionary_list = [table1_season_16_17, table1_season_17_18, table1_season_18_19]

### Comparing the seasons
In the compare_seasons function, we are .....

def compare_seasons(data):
    dict1 = {}
    for i in data:
        for x in i.keys():
            # Creating a aggregate dictionary of all the teams that has been attending the premier league for the last three seasons.             
            dict1[x]={"Games_played":0, 'Wins': 0, 'Losses': 0, 'Draws': 0, 'Points': 0, 'Goal_diff': 0, 'Yellow_cards': 0}
    assert len(dict1.keys()) == 26   
    
    number_of_iterations = 0
    for i in data:
        number_of_iterations += 1
        for x in i.keys():
            dict1[x]["Games_played"] += i[x]["Games_played"]
            dict1[x]['Wins'] += i[x]["Wins"]
            dict1[x]['Losses'] += i[x]["Losses"]
            dict1[x]['Draws'] += i[x]["Draws"]
            dict1[x]['Points'] += i[x]["Points"]
            dict1[x]['Goal_diff'] += i[x]["Goal_diff"]
            dict1[x]['Yellow_cards'] += i[x]["Yellow_cards"]
    
    # Making the data compareable by dividing total stats by the number of matches played:

    for i in dict1:
        dict1[i]['Wins'] = int((dict1[i]["Wins"]/dict1[i]["Games_played"])*38)
        dict1[i]['Losses'] = int((dict1[i]["Losses"]/dict1[i]["Games_played"])*38)
        dict1[i]['Draws'] = int((dict1[i]["Draws"]/dict1[i]["Games_played"])*38)
        dict1[i]['Points'] = int((dict1[i]["Points"]/dict1[i]["Games_played"])*38)
        dict1[i]['Goal_diff'] = int((dict1[i]["Goal_diff"]/dict1[i]["Games_played"])*38)
        dict1[i]['Yellow_cards'] = int((dict1[i]["Yellow_cards"]/dict1[i]["Games_played"])*38)
    
    aggregate_table = rank_teams(dict1)
    return aggregate_table
        
merged_table = compare_seasons(merge_dictionary_list)


### Visualisation of the data
In the visualise_data function, we are taking the dictionary and convert it into a league table. 

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualise_table(data, season):
    df = pd.DataFrame(data).T
    df["Rank"] = np.arange(1, len(df)+1)
    df["Team"] = df.index
    df.set_index("Rank", inplace = True)
    df = df[['Team','Games_played', 'Wins', 'Losses', 'Draws','Goal_diff','Points']]
    print("\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("------------------- Premier League table {} season -------------------".format(season))
    print("---------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print(df)

table_visualisation = visualise_table(table1_season_16_17, "2016-17")
table_visualisation = visualise_table(table1_season_17_18, "2017-18")
table_visualisation = visualise_table(table1_season_18_19, "2018-19")
print("\n\n")
table_visualisation = visualise_table(merged_table, "2016-19 comparable")
